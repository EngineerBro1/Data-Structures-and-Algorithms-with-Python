Data Structures:
Data structures are the way we are able to store and retrieve data. Youâ€™re already familiar with Python lists and dictionaries, so you know that lists and arrays are sequential with data accessed by index while dictionaries and objects use a named key to store and retrieve information.

Data structures handle four main functions for us:

Inputting information >> Processing information >> Maintaining information >> Retrieving information

1.Inputting is largely concerned with how the data is received. What kind of information can be included? Will the new data be added to the beginning, end, or somewhere in the middle of the existing data? Does an existing point of data need to be updated or destroyed?
2.Processing is about how data is manipulated in the data structure. This can occur concurrently or as a result of other processes that data structures handle. How does existing data that has been stored need to change to accommodate new, updated, or removed data?
3.Maintaining is focused on how the data is organized within the structure. Which relationships need to be maintained between pieces of data? How much memory must the system reserve (allocate) to accommodate the data?
4.Retrieving is devoted to finding and returning the data that is stored in the structure. How can we access that information again? What steps does the data structure need to take to get the information back to us?


A data structure is classified into two categories:
I.Linear data structure
II.Non-linear data structure

I.Linear data structure
In linear data structures, data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is connected to its previous and next element.This arrangement makes it easy to traverse the structure in a single pass.

II.Non-linear data structure
In non-linear data structures, data elements are not arranged in a sequential manner. Instead, they are organized in a hierarchical or interconnected form, which allows for more complex relationships between elements. 


Algorithms:
Algorithms are instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks. There are many, many types of algorithms
I.  Sorting algorithms
II. Search algorithms
III.Divide and conquer algorithms
IV. Greedy algorithms
V.  Brute force algorithms
